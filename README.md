Resume Screener is an AI-powered web application designed to automate the resume screening process for job roles like Software Developer Intern, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer. It allows users to upload their resumes, which are then evaluated using machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity. The system predicts eligibility, calculates a resume score, detects fraudulent or AI-generated content through rule-based logic and NLP, and suggests better-suited job roles if the applicant is not eligible. It also performs skill gap analysis by identifying missing skills and recommending relevant courses. The platform delivers real-time results, ensuring fast and fair screening for recruiters while guiding applicants toward career improvement. Future enhancements include deep learning-based parsing, LinkedIn integration, and a smart resume chatbot for feedback and preparation.
